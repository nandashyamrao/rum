| **Web Event**                   | **Analogy: Dining at a Restaurant**                                                  |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Navigation Start**           | You decide to go to a restaurant and start walking toward it.                        |
| **DNS Lookup**                 | You look up the address of the restaurant.                                           |
| **TCP & TLS Handshake**        | You reach the restaurant, get through security, and are greeted by the host.         |
| **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**  | You tell the waiter your order, and they say “Got it!” — first response from kitchen.|
| **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**| The waiter brings you a glass of water or some bread — the first thing you see.      |
| **DOMContentLoaded**           | The waiter brings you the full menu and explains it — the structure is ready.        |
| **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**| Your main course arrives — the most important part of the experience.            |
| **Load Event**                 | Everything has been served — including drinks, dessert, and napkins.                |
| **First Input (INP)**          | You ask for the bill and see how quickly they respond — first interaction.          |
| **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**| Imagine your table and chair keep shifting while you're eating — very distracting. |
